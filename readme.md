# Project: Flask Web Application for House Price Prediction Using a Machine Learning Model

In this project, I developed the predictive power of a model trained on house price data. It deploys with flask API and uses Linear Regression to predict the price value. Deploy Machine Learning Model Using Flask to take a model from python code.This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers.

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/ for UI
